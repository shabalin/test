            If the user chooses to authorize your application, 
            Iconfinder redirects back to your site at the callback URL you configured for your application when registering it. 
            The URL will include with an intermediate `code` in the code request parameter as well as the opaque `state` value if provided. 
            If no `code` parameter is provided, 
            it means that the user did not choose to authorize your application. 
            If you supplied a `state` parameter, make sure to validate this to avoid security vulnerabilities.
