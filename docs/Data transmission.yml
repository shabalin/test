    ### Data types
    
    Blank fields, ie. fields whose value would be a JSON null, 
    are omitted to keep the response size to a minimum.
    All timestamps are returned as strings in the ISO 8601 format of arbitrary 
    precision guaranteed to be in UTC:
    
    ```
    <YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>T<HH>:<MM>:<SS>Z
    <YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>T<HH>:<MM>:<SS>.<mmm>Z
    ```
    
    ### Summaries and detailed representations
    
    Depending on the endpoint used, either a summary or a detailed representation
    of a resource will be returned. Generally, listing and search endpoints such 
    as `/v2/iconsets` will return summaries while resource specific
    endpoints such as `/v2/iconsets/<icon set ID>` will return a detailed representation.
    
    While the levels of detail in the representations differ, 
    detailed representations are guaranteed to at least contain the same information 
    in the same structure as summary representations.
