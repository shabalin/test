    The Iconfinder API version 2.0 supports [Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) for AJAX requests, 
    independent of the request origin.
    This means that the API can be used for unauthenticated AJAX requests:
    
    ```
    $ curl -i https://api.iconfinder.com/v2/iconsets
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset
    ```
    
    ### Cross-domain policy
    
    For usage in Flash based applications, the Iconfinder API has a cross-domain policy file allowing full access over HTTPS. 
    See https://api.iconfinder.com/crossdomain.xml for details.
