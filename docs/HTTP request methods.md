Where possible, the Iconfinder REST API strives to use appropriate HTTP methods for each action:

| Method        | Action        |
| ------------- |---------------|
| `HEAD`     | Retrieve HTTP header information for one or more resources. Do not rely on this information between requests. |
| `GET`      | Retrieve one or more resources.   |   
| `POST` | Create a resource or perform a custom action.     |  
| `PATCH` | Partially update a resource.    |  
| `PUT` |Completely replace a resource.     |  
| `DELETE` | Delete a resource.      |
