    The Iconfinder API version 2.0 employs strict rate limiting depending on the authentication method. 
    For `OAuth 2.0` authenticated requests, you can make up to 5,000 requests per hour for each authorized user. 
    For unautheticated requests, you can make 15 requests per minute.
    
    > Rate limits may change during the beta period of Iconfinder API version 2.0.
    
    Not all requests count towards your request rate. Using [conditional requests](https://developer.iconfinder.com/api/2.0/overview.html#conditional-requests) to ease the load on Iconfinder's servers will only count towards your request rate if a resource has changed.
    
    All responses from the API contain information about the current state of rate limiting:
    
    ```
    $ curl -i https://api.iconfinder.com/v2/iconsets
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2014 13:26:48 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Connection: keep-alive
    X-RateLimit-Limit: 15
    X-RateLimit-Remaining: 14
    X-RateLimit-Reset: Mon, 21 Apr 2014 13:27:48 GMT
    ```
    
    The special `X-RateLimit-` headers have the following meaning:
    
    | Header name        | Description           |
    | ------------- | ------------- |
    | `X-RateLimit-Limit`      | Current rate limit for the authentication method used. |
    | `X-RateLimit-Remaining`      | Requests remaining until rate limit is reached.      |
    | `X-RateLimit-Reset`      | Time at which the request counter is reset.     |
    
    
    ### Hitting the wall
    
    If you exceed the request rate limit, the Iconfinder API will return a `429 Too Many Requests`
    response code with the following content:
    
    ```
    $ curl -i https://api.iconfinder.com/v2/iconsets
    
    HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
    Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2014 13:27:04 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Connection: keep-alive
    X-RateLimit-Limit: 15
    X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
    X-RateLimit-Reset: Mon, 21 Apr 2014 13:27:48 GMT
    
    {
        "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
        "message": "API rate limit exceeded"
    }
    ```
    
      
    If you need a higher rate limit, please contact [support](mailto:support@iconfinder.com) with details about your use case.
    
    ### Unauthenticated requests with higher rate limit
    
    
    If you need to make unauthenticated requests to the API with a higher rate limit, 
    you can send the client ID and secret of your API application along with the request. 
    The rate limit will then be the same as for an authenticated request, 
    but the limit is applied at an application level rather than authorization level:
    
    ```http
    $ curl -i https://api.iconfinder.com/v2/iconsets?client_id=x&client_secret=y
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2014 13:26:48 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Connection: keep-alive
    X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
    X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4999
    X-RateLimit-Reset: Mon, 21 Apr 2014 13:27:48 GMT
    ```
    > Only use this method for server-to-server calls. **Never** share your application's 
    client secret with anyone or include it in client-side browser code.
