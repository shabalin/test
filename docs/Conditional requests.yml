    Most API version 2.0 endpoints expose a modification time of resources in the `Last-Modified` header. 
    The modification time can be used in subsequent requests to the same endpoints using the 
    `If-Modified-Since` conditional header. 
    If the resource has not been modified between requests, 
    the response status code will be `304 Not Modified`.
    
    It is heavily encouraged that server-to-server communications cache responses and use the conditional request mechanisms to reduce the load on the Iconfinder API servers.
